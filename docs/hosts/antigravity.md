# Agent Blueprint on Antigravity

Binary `agy`; facts checked against Antigravity CLI 1.2.12 on 2026-09-30.

## Install

One route: `agy plugin install` from a checkout. The source root must hold `plugin.json`, which this repository has at its root.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ninety2UA/agent-blueprint.git
agy plugin install ./agent-blueprint
```

The docs document the directory form. A git URL (`agy plugin install https://github.com/Ninety2UA/agent-blueprint`) worked for another plugin on 1.0.10 per a third-party report and is not verified on 1.2.12; it is checked after the repository rename. `bash install.sh` runs `agy plugin install <checkout>` for Antigravity, because a copy in `~/.agents/skills` would not reach it: Antigravity does not scan that folder. The installed copy lives at `~/.gemini/config/plugins/agent-blueprint` on 1.2.12; `agy plugin list` shows it.

Trust step: none for the install. For headless runs, `allowNonWorkspaceAccess` must be `true` in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`, or a run stalls the first time a skill reads a prompt file inside the installed plugin, outside the workspace. The runner's preflight checks the key and prints the fix, which also sets `toolPermission` and `artifactReviewPolicy` to `always-proceed`.

What covers what: no other host's install covers Antigravity, and an Antigravity install covers no other host. Antigravity does read a project's `.agents/skills/`, so an `amp skill add` into a project shows its skills here too; keep one route.

Check: `agy plugin list` shows `agent-blueprint` with its components; `agy plugin validate ./agent-blueprint` checks a checkout and reports each section as processed or skipped. Update: pull the checkout and run `agy plugin install` again, or the ab-plugin-update skill. Docs: <https://antigravity.google/docs/plugins>.

## Invoke a skill

- Explicit: `/ab-name`.
- By description: Antigravity picks a skill whose description matches the request.
- Manual-only: not verified. Antigravity documents no `disable-model-invocation` or other implicit-invocation control, so it may pick `ab-plugin-update` or `ab-migrate` from a matching request. Both descriptions avoid broad trigger words, and `ab-migrate` asks before it removes anything.

## Model and effort

`/model` persists the choice in the session. Per a third-party report the flags are `--model <slug>` and `--effort low|medium|high`, and `agy models` lists the models; neither is verified here. Helpers: `invoke_subagent` documents no per-dispatch model or effort, only a `model` tier (`inherit|flash|pro`) in an agent definition, which the blueprint does not ship; whether an ad hoc helper inherits the session's setting is not verified, so a step marked safe at lower effort runs at the session's level. Docs: <https://antigravity.google/docs/subagents>.

## What is missing or different

- Hooks: none. The blueprint ships no `hooks.json` for Antigravity, so the five hook effects are absent: the session-start pointer to `docs/context/STATUS.md` (Antigravity has no session-start event in any case), the injection scanner on writes, the commit-message check, the ship-pipeline Stop guard and the Agent Teams gates. Nothing else depends on them. Per a third-party report, `PreToolUse` hooks do not fire under `--dangerously-skip-permissions` anyway.
- Helpers: `invoke_subagent`, asynchronous and parallel, started fresh without the parent's history; a helper's workspace can be a git worktree (`branch` mode). No documented cap.
- Team work: no cap in `host-limits.tsv`; worktree isolation. Antigravity's Teamwork mode (`/teamwork-preview`) is paid, in preview and opens with a user interview, so no skill drives it.
- Questions: `ask_question`, a blocking question tool (per the compound-engineering spec, not the docs); a headless run takes the documented default.
- Task tracking: the plan file's checkboxes; `/tasks` is a user command, and a model-callable todo tool is not verified.
- Instructions: Antigravity reads `GEMINI.md` and `AGENTS.md` at the workspace root; per a third-party report `GEMINI.md` wins on conflict and `CLAUDE.md` is not read.
- Paths inside a skill: per a third-party report a relative path written in a SKILL.md does not resolve on its own, which is why every skill locates its scripts from its own folder; a spike on 1.2.12 confirmed a skill reads its own `references/` file headlessly.

## Unattended runs

Run from the project root, with the path to the skill folder as installed (a checkout is shown):

```bash
bash /path/to/agent-blueprint/skills/ab-ship-pipeline/scripts/run.sh --host agy --allow-unguarded "<feature>"
```

Posture: `agy -p --output-format json --dangerously-skip-permissions`. That flag is the only way a headless run completes without waiting for an approval (without it a run may stall on a permission prompt), and it leaves no guard: hooks do not fire under it, and per a third-party report `--sandbox` can be bypassed with it. So the runner requires `--allow-unguarded`, which means: the agent holds your git and `gh` credentials for the whole run, and the runner's secret scan and publish checks cannot contain what it does before it publishes. Run it in a throwaway clone or a container. Per-iteration timeout: 2400 s, shorter than on the other hosts because of earlier headless hang reports (antigravity-cli#548); a check on 1.2.12 completed file writes, shell commands and a project skill cleanly. Preflight: credentials (`~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`), `allowNonWorkspaceAccess`, and a warning when the project is not under `trustedWorkspaces`.

## Privacy

Nothing beyond the host's own terms is known.

## Paths to avoid

- `.claude/`: not read by Antigravity (per a third-party report), and v4 keeps working files under `.agent-blueprint/`.
- `~/.agents/skills`: not scanned, so the copy route does not reach Antigravity.
- `.claude-plugin/`: not read natively; `agy plugin import claude` converts a Claude Code install, which would give you a second copy.
- `hooks/hooks.json` and a root `hooks.json`: neither is present in this plugin.

## Smoke status

Pending: the v4.0.0 smoke table (docs/releases/v4.0.0-smoke.md) fills this section.
