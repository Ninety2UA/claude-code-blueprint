description: "Trigger this skill when a project has v2.x blueprint files (.claude/commands/, .claude/skills/, .claude/agents/) and needs to switch to v3.0 plugin mode — even if the user doesn't know they need to migrate. Trigger when the user says 'migrate', 'migrate to plugin', 'upgrade from v2', 'remove old files', 'switch to plugin mode', 'convert to plugin', 'clean up old blueprint files', or when you detect stale v2.x engine files in the project's .claude/ directory. Removes engine files while preserving project state (CLAUDE.md, STATUS.md, BACKLOG.md, CONVENTIONS.md, solutions/). DO NOT TRIGGER for updating an already-installed v3.0 plugin — use plugin-update instead."

# Migrate to Plugin — Blueprint v2.x to v3.0 Migration

This skill migrates a project from the v2.x install-script model (engine files copied into the project) to the v3.0 plugin model (engine files provided by the plugin, only project state in-project).

**Announce at start:** "Starting migration from blueprint v2.x to plugin mode."

## Step 1: Verify Plugin Is Installed

Check that the blueprint plugin is available by verifying you can access blueprint skills (e.g., the brainstorming skill). If the plugin is NOT installed:

```
STOP. The blueprint plugin must be installed first.
Run: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ninety2UA/claude-code-blueprint/main/install.sh | bash
Then re-run the migrate-to-plugin skill.
```

## Step 2: Detect In-Project Engine Files

Check for v2.x engine files in the project:

```bash
ls .claude/commands/ 2>/dev/null | head -3
ls .claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null | head -3
ls .claude/agents/ 2>/dev/null | head -3
ls .claude/hooks/ 2>/dev/null | head -3
ls hooks/hooks.json 2>/dev/null
ls .claude-plugin/plugin.json 2>/dev/null
```

If NONE of these directories exist, report: "No v2.x engine files found. This project is already in plugin mode or was never installed." and stop.

## Step 3: Check for Local Modifications

For each engine file found, check if it has been modified from the template:

```bash
git status .claude/commands/ .claude/skills/ .claude/agents/ .claude/hooks/ hooks/ .claude-plugin/ 2>/dev/null
git diff --stat HEAD -- .claude/commands/ .claude/skills/ .claude/agents/ .claude/hooks/ 2>/dev/null
```

If any engine files have been locally modified:
- List the modified files
- Ask: "These files have local modifications. They will be REMOVED during migration (the plugin version will be used instead). Do you want to: (a) Back up modified files to `.claude/custom-overrides/` before removing, or (b) Remove them (plugin versions are identical to the template)?"
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

## Step 4: Create Backup Branch

```bash
git stash push -m "pre-migration-stash" 2>/dev/null || true
git checkout -b blueprint-v2-backup 2>/dev/null || true
git checkout - 2>/dev/null || true
```

Report: "Backup branch `blueprint-v2-backup` created at current HEAD."

## Step 5: Remove Engine Files

Remove the following directories/files that are now provided by the plugin:

```bash
# Engine directories
rm -rf .claude/commands/
rm -rf .claude/skills/
rm -rf .claude/agents/
rm -rf .claude/hooks/

# Plugin/hook config (now in plugin)
rm -rf .claude-plugin/
rm -rf hooks/

# Settings (now in plugin)
rm -f .claude/settings.json

# Clean up empty .claude/ if nothing remains
rmdir .claude/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Step 6: Keep Project State Files

Verify these files still exist (they should NOT have been removed):
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `BACKLOG.md`
- `blueprint.local.md`
- `docs/context/CONVENTIONS.md`
- `docs/context/GOALS.md`
- `docs/context/STATUS.md`
- `docs/plans/`
- `docs/solutions/`
- `docs/learnings/`
- `docs/decisions/`
- `docs/research/`
- `docs/specs/`

If any are missing, report them as a warning.

## Step 7: Verify Plugin Skills Work

Quick verification: invoke the brainstorming skill to confirm the plugin is providing engine files correctly.

## Step 8: Report

```
Migration complete! v2.x → v3.0 (plugin mode)

Removed:
  .claude/commands/    (files → now from plugin)
  .claude/skills/      (dirs → now from plugin)
  .claude/agents/      (files → now from plugin)
  .claude/hooks/       (files → now from plugin)
  .claude-plugin/      (plugin manifest → now from plugin)
  hooks/               (hook config → now from plugin)

Kept:
  CLAUDE.md, BACKLOG.md, blueprint.local.md
  docs/ (all project state)

Backup: branch `blueprint-v2-backup`

Next: Commit this cleanup with `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: migrate to blueprint plugin v3.0"`
```
