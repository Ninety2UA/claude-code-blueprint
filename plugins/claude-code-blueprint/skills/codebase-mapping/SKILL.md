# Codebase Mapping

## Overview

Map an unfamiliar codebase into structured documentation before making any changes. The map becomes the shared context for all subsequent development work.

## When to Use

- Joining a new project for the first time
- Before modifying a module you haven't worked in before
- When onboarding new team members who need codebase orientation
- After a major refactor to update the team's mental model

## The Iron Law

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT modify any source code, tests, or configuration until the codebase map is complete and saved. Mapping is a read-only operation. If you discover something that needs fixing, add it to the map's Concerns section — not inline.
</HARD-GATE>

## Process

### Step 1: Dispatch the Mapper

Dispatch the **codebase-mapper** agent with the scope of the mapping:

```
Task: Map the [project/module] codebase.
Focus area: [specific area if provided, or "full project"]
Save findings in the format specified by your output template.
```

If the codebase is large, dispatch multiple mapper agents in parallel — one per major module or directory.

### Step 2: Review the Map

When the agent returns, review the map for:
- Completeness — are all major modules covered?
- Accuracy — do the descriptions match what you see in the code?
- Actionability — can a developer use this to navigate the codebase?

### Step 3: Save the Map

Save the map to `docs/context/CODEBASE-MAP.md` (or `docs/context/MAP-[module-name].md` for focused maps).

If `docs/context/CONVENTIONS.md` doesn't exist yet, extract the convention findings from the map into a new CONVENTIONS.md.

### Step 4: Orient the Session

Present the key findings to the user:
- Architecture pattern and primary data flow
- Top concerns (ordered by severity)
- Recommended areas to investigate further

## Quick Reference

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Full project | `docs/context/CODEBASE-MAP.md` |
| Specific module | `docs/context/MAP-[module].md` |
| Conventions found | Update `docs/context/CONVENTIONS.md` |
| Concerns found | List in map + add critical ones to `BACKLOG.md` |

## Common Mistakes

**Mapping too deep too early** — Start with the top 3 directory levels. Go deeper only in areas the user needs to modify. A complete map of a large codebase is a project, not a task.

**Modifying code while mapping** — The map must be done before changes start. If you find a bug, note it. Don't fix it mid-map.

**Mapping without a focus** — If the user says "map the auth module," don't map the entire codebase. Stay focused on what's needed for the current task.
