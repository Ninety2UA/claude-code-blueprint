# Swarm Orchestration

## Overview

A swarm is a group of specialized agents dispatched simultaneously to analyze or work on different aspects of the same problem. Unlike wave-orchestration (which handles task dependencies), swarm-orchestration is for cases where multiple independent perspectives are needed on the same input.

**Core principle:** Many focused eyes catch more than one broad scan.

## When to Use

- **Review swarms:** Multiple reviewers each checking different quality dimensions
- **Research swarms:** Multiple researchers each investigating different aspects
- **Analysis swarms:** Multiple analysts each evaluating different risk areas
- **Audit swarms:** Multiple auditors each checking different compliance areas

**Don't use when:**
- Tasks modify shared state (use wave-orchestration instead)
- Tasks are sequential (use autonomous-loop)
- Only one perspective is needed (dispatch a single agent)

## Swarm Architecture

```

    ├── Agent A (specialist focus)  ─┐
    ├── Agent B (specialist focus)   ├── All run in parallel
    ├── Agent C (specialist focus)   │
    └── Agent D (specialist focus)  ─┘
              │

## Pre-Built Swarm Configurations

### Review Swarm

Used by `/review-swarm`. Dispatches:
- code-reviewer
- security-sentinel
- performance-oracle
- code-simplicity-reviewer
- convention-enforcer
- test-coverage-reviewer

Synthesized by: **findings-synthesizer**

### Research Swarm

Used by `/deep-research`. Dispatches:
- learnings-researcher
- framework-docs-researcher
- best-practices-researcher
- git-history-analyzer
- codebase-context-mapper

Synthesized by: **research-synthesizer**

### Custom Swarms

You can compose custom swarms for specific needs:

**Migration Swarm:**
- data-integrity-guardian (migration safety)
- schema-drift-detector (unrelated schema changes)
- performance-oracle (query performance impact)
- deployment-verifier (deployment safety)

**Architecture Swarm:**
- architecture-strategist (pattern compliance)
- code-simplicity-reviewer (complexity assessment)
- performance-oracle (scalability)
- integration-checker (wiring correctness)

## Process

### Step 1: Select Agents

Choose agents based on the task:
1. What perspectives are needed?
2. Which agents provide those perspectives?
3. Are there project-specific agent overrides in `blueprint.local.md`?

### Step 2: Prepare Shared Context

All agents in a swarm need the same base context:
- The code/diff/files to analyze
- Project conventions and standards
- Specific focus area for each agent
- Output format requirements (consistent across all agents for synthesis)

### Step 3: Dispatch All Simultaneously

```
// All in a single message for maximum parallelism
Task("agent-A: [focus]. Context: [shared context]. Report findings as P1/P2/P3 with file:line locations.")
Task("agent-B: [focus]. Context: [shared context]. Report findings as P1/P2/P3 with file:line locations.")
Task("agent-C: [focus]. Context: [shared context]. Report findings as P1/P2/P3 with file:line locations.")
Task("agent-D: [focus]. Context: [shared context]. Report findings as P1/P2/P3 with file:line locations.")
```

**Critical:** Dispatch ALL in one message. Sequential dispatch negates the benefit.

### Step 4: Collect Results

Wait for all agents to return. Do not act on partial results — the synthesizer needs all outputs.

### Step 5: Synthesize

Dispatch the appropriate synthesizer agent with ALL outputs:
- For review swarms → **findings-synthesizer**
- For research swarms → **research-synthesizer**

The synthesizer de-duplicates, resolves contradictions, and produces one unified report.

### Step 6: Act on Results

Present the synthesized report and offer next steps:
- For review findings: offer to fix via resolve-in-parallel
- For research findings: offer to proceed to `/plan`

## Scaling Guidelines

| Swarm Size | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 2-3 agents | Always fine. Low overhead. |
| 4-6 agents | Sweet spot. Good coverage without excessive token cost. |
| 7-10 agents | Use when comprehensive coverage needed (full review swarm). |
| 10+ agents | Diminishing returns. Split into focused sub-swarms. |

## Cost Awareness

Each agent in a swarm gets its own 200K context window. A 6-agent review swarm uses ~6x the tokens of a single reviewer. The trade-off is:
- **Breadth:** 6 specialists catch issues a generalist misses
- **Speed:** Parallel execution is faster than 6 sequential reviews
- **Cost:** 6x token usage

For small changes (< 50 lines), a single code-reviewer is usually sufficient. Reserve full swarms for significant changes (new features, refactors, pre-release).

## Common Mistakes

**Sequential dispatch** — Dispatching agents one at a time defeats the purpose. Use a single message with all Task() calls.

**Missing synthesizer** — Raw outputs from 6 agents are noisy and duplicative. Always synthesize.

**Wrong swarm for the job** — If agents need to build on each other's work, use wave-orchestration, not a swarm. If they need to discuss and coordinate in real time, use Agent Teams (`/team`).

**No shared output format** — If each agent reports in a different format, synthesis is much harder. Specify the format in the dispatch prompt.

## Swarms vs Agent Teams

Swarms and Agent Teams serve different purposes and complement each other:

| Aspect | Swarms | Agent Teams |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Communication** | One-way (report to controller) | Multi-directional (teammates message each other) |
| **Best for** | Parallel analysis (review, research) | Collaborative implementation |
| **File access** | Read-only (analysis agents) | Read-write (each teammate owns files) |
| **Coordination** | Synthesizer merges outputs | Shared task list + messaging |
| **When to use** | Multiple perspectives on same code | Complex multi-file implementation |

**Typical workflow:** `/deep-research` (swarm) → `/plan` → `/team` (agent teams) → `/review-swarm` (swarm)
