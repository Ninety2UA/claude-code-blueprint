# Review Swarm — Multi-Agent Parallel Review

Dispatch a swarm of specialized review agents in parallel, then synthesize their findings into one prioritized report.

**Announce at start:** "Starting review swarm — dispatching specialized reviewers in parallel."

## Step 1: Determine Scope

Identify what to review:
- If arguments specify files or scope, use that
- Otherwise, review uncommitted changes (`git diff`) or the last commit (`git diff HEAD~1`)
- For a PR review, use `git diff main...HEAD`

## Step 2: Select Reviewers (Conditional Activation)

Check if `blueprint.local.md` exists in the project root. If it does, read the `review-agents` list from its YAML frontmatter to determine which agents to dispatch. If it doesn't exist, use the default activation rules below.

### Always-On Reviewers (dispatched every time)

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **code-reviewer** | Plan alignment, code quality, architecture |
| **code-simplicity-reviewer** | YAGNI, over-engineering, unnecessary complexity |
| **test-coverage-reviewer** | Test quality and behavioral coverage |

### Conditional Reviewers (activated by content signals)

Scan the diff/files to determine which conditional reviewers to activate. A reviewer activates when ANY of its signals are present.

| Agent | Activation Signals | Skip When |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **security-sentinel** | Diff touches auth, sessions, tokens, passwords, API keys, user input handling, SQL/ORM queries, file uploads, CORS config, or environment variables | Pure styling/docs changes |
| **performance-oracle** | Diff touches database queries, loops over collections, API endpoints, caching logic, or file I/O; OR diff is 200+ lines (large changes have hidden perf implications) | < 50 lines touching only UI/tests |
| **convention-enforcer** | Diff introduces new files, new patterns, or touches config/build files; OR diff modifies 5+ files (cross-cutting changes need convention checks) | Single-file bug fix following existing patterns |
| **frontend-reviewer** | Diff contains CSS, HTML templates, JSX/TSX components, style imports, responsive/a11y attributes, or browser API usage | No frontend files in diff |
| **architecture-strategist** | Diff adds new services, modules, or API endpoints; modifies dependency injection; changes directory structure; OR introduces new abstractions | Bug fix within existing architecture |
| **data-integrity-guardian** | Diff contains migration files, schema changes, model validations, data transformation logic, or bulk operations | No data layer changes |
| **schema-drift-detector** | Diff modifies schema.rb, migration files, or ORM model definitions | No schema-related files |

### Activation Process

1. Read the diff (from Step 1)
2. For each conditional reviewer, check its activation signals against the diff
3. Log which conditional reviewers are activated and why: "Activating security-sentinel: diff touches `src/auth/`"
4. Log which conditional reviewers are skipped: "Skipping frontend-reviewer: no frontend files in diff"
5. Combine always-on + activated conditional reviewers = final dispatch list

**Override:** `--full` flag dispatches ALL agents regardless of activation signals.

## Step 3: Prepare Review Context

Generate a `run_id` for this review (timestamp-based or short UUID): `review-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`. Create `.claude/review-runs/{run_id}/` if it does not exist.

For each agent, prepare a focused prompt that includes:
1. The diff or file list to review
2. Relevant project conventions from `docs/context/CONVENTIONS.md`
3. The agent's specific focus area
4. The shared calibration rubric: anchored confidence scoring (0/25/50/75/100), remediation tier (safe_auto/gated_auto/advisory/present), and the standard finding format (see `references/review-calibration.md`)
5. **The two-output contract** (see `references/output-contract.md`): each reviewer writes a full-detail JSON artifact to `.claude/review-runs/{run_id}/{reviewer_name}.json` AND returns a compact merge-tier object to the orchestrator. Detail-tier fields (`why_it_matters`, `evidence`) live in the artifact file only; the compact return omits them so the synthesizer's context stays lean.
6. The `run_id` and `reviewer_name` for the artifact path.

**Input hygiene — feed the artifact, not the author's verdict.** Each reviewer's prompt should carry the artifact (diff/files) and the contract it must meet — spec, plan, conventions — and nothing that asserts the work is already correct. Strip the author's own summary of correctness, self-assessment, and "this handles X" claims: they anchor the reviewer toward agreement and turn review into confirmation. Frame each reviewer's job as *disproof* — "find where this violates its contract," not "check whether this looks right." A reviewer who sets out to break the artifact and fails has produced far stronger evidence than one who set out to confirm it and succeeded. This sharpens the per-reviewer adversarial stance each reviewer agent already carries (e.g. code-reviewer treats author claims as "not evidence"); it does not replace it.

## Step 4: Dispatch All Agents in Parallel

Use the Task tool to dispatch all selected agents simultaneously. Each agent gets an independent 200K context window.

```
Task("security-sentinel: Review [scope] for security issues. run_id={run_id}. [diff/files]. Per references/output-contract.md: write full findings to .claude/review-runs/{run_id}/security-sentinel.json; return compact merge-tier object.")
Task("performance-oracle: Review [scope] for performance issues. run_id={run_id}. ...")
Task("code-reviewer: Review [scope] against plan and standards. run_id={run_id}. ...")
... (all agents in parallel)
```

**Important:** Dispatch ALL agents in a single message to maximize parallelism.

**Session cap:** Claude Code allows up to 200 subagents per session. A single swarm (6-10 reviewers plus the optional validator/synthesizer) stays well within it; if you run many swarms in one session, watch the cumulative total.

## Step 5: Collect, Validate, Synthesize

When all reviewers return, the flow has two synthesis stages:

### 5a: Independent validation (optional, recommended for >5 findings)

Dispatch the **findings-validator** agent with the merged compact returns. The validator does an independent re-verification per surviving finding (3 questions: real in current code? introduced by this diff? not handled elsewhere?) and returns `{validated, reason}` per finding. Conservative bias — when in doubt, reject.

```
Task("findings-validator: Validate these findings against the diff. run_id={run_id}. [merged finding list]")
```

This step is an FP backstop. Findings the validator rejects are dropped before synthesis. Skip when the swarm produced ≤5 findings (validator overhead exceeds the benefit on small sets).

### 5b: Synthesis

Dispatch the **findings-synthesizer** agent with the validated outputs:

```
Task("findings-synthesizer: Synthesize these validated review outputs into one prioritized report. run_id={run_id}. Artifacts at .claude/review-runs/{run_id}/. [validated finding list]")
```

The synthesizer will:
- De-duplicate overlapping findings (cross-reviewer fingerprint match)
- Collapse same-persona redundancy (one reviewer flooding with variants)
- Apply premise-dependency chain linking (root + dependents)
- Resolve contradictions (combined finding presenting both perspectives)
- Apply deterministic recommended-action tie-break (Skip > Defer > Apply)
- Read artifact files for detail-tier fields when surfaces need them
- Recommend fix order

## Step 6: Present Results

Present the synthesized report to the user. Highlight:
- P1 count (must fix before merge)
- P2 count (should fix)
- P3 count (suggestions)

**If actionable findings (gated_auto + manual + advisory) exceed 5**, load `references/walkthrough.md` and offer per-finding walkthrough mode instead of a bulk fix dispatch — per-item decisions don't fit a numbered list at high volume.

For ≤5 findings, ask: **"Would you like me to resolve these findings? I can dispatch agents in parallel to fix independent issues."**

If the user says yes (and finding count ≤5), read and invoke the resolve-in-parallel skill to fix independent findings concurrently. For >5 findings, route through the walkthrough.

## Quick Reference

| Usage | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Default | Review uncommitted changes or last commit |
| `--pr` | Review all changes on current branch vs main |
| `src/auth/` | Review only files in src/auth/ |
| `--full` | Dispatch ALL agents including optional ones |
