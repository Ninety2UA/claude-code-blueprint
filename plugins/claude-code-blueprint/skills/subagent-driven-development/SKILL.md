description: "Trigger this skill when executing plans with independent tasks in the current session using fresh subagents per task — for isolation and clean context on each task. Trigger when you have an implementation plan with mostly independent tasks and want to stay in the current session rather than using parallel worktrees. Dispatches a fresh subagent per task with two-stage review after each (spec compliance then code quality). Usually invoked internally by executing-plans — not typically called directly by users. DO NOT TRIGGER for tightly coupled tasks that share state — use sequential execution instead. DO NOT TRIGGER when parallel session execution is preferred — use executing-plans with orchestrate instead."

# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Have implementation plan?" [shape=diamond];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" [shape=diamond];
    "Stay in this session?" [shape=diamond];
    "subagent-driven-development" [shape=box];
    "executing-plans" [shape=box];
    "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [shape=box];

    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Tasks mostly independent?" [label="yes"];
    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Stay in this session?" [label="yes"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no - tightly coupled"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "subagent-driven-development" [label="yes"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "executing-plans" [label="no - parallel session"];
}
```

**vs. Executing Plans (parallel session):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Two-stage review after each task: spec compliance first, then code quality
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

## The Process

```dot
digraph process {
    rankdir=TB;

    subgraph cluster_per_task {
        label="Per Task";
        "Dispatch implementer subagent (./implementer-prompt.md)" [shape=box];
        "Implementer subagent asks questions?" [shape=diamond];
        "Answer questions, provide context" [shape=box];
        "Implementer subagent implements, tests, commits, self-reviews" [shape=box];
        "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent (./spec-reviewer-prompt.md)" [shape=box];
        "Spec reviewer subagent confirms code matches spec?" [shape=diamond];
        "Implementer subagent fixes spec gaps" [shape=box];
        "Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent (./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md)" [shape=box];
        "Code quality reviewer subagent approves?" [shape=diamond];
        "Implementer subagent fixes quality issues" [shape=box];
        "Tick task in progress file" [shape=box];
    }

    "Read plan, extract all tasks with full text, note context, create progress file" [shape=box];
    "More tasks remain?" [shape=diamond];
    "Dispatch final code reviewer subagent for entire implementation" [shape=box];
    "Use finishing-a-development-branch" [shape=box style=filled fillcolor=lightgreen];

    "Read plan, extract all tasks with full text, note context, create progress file" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent (./implementer-prompt.md)";
    "Dispatch implementer subagent (./implementer-prompt.md)" -> "Implementer subagent asks questions?";
    "Implementer subagent asks questions?" -> "Answer questions, provide context" [label="yes"];
    "Answer questions, provide context" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent (./implementer-prompt.md)";
    "Implementer subagent asks questions?" -> "Implementer subagent implements, tests, commits, self-reviews" [label="no"];
    "Implementer subagent implements, tests, commits, self-reviews" -> "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent (./spec-reviewer-prompt.md)";
    "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent (./spec-reviewer-prompt.md)" -> "Spec reviewer subagent confirms code matches spec?";
    "Spec reviewer subagent confirms code matches spec?" -> "Implementer subagent fixes spec gaps" [label="no"];
    "Implementer subagent fixes spec gaps" -> "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent (./spec-reviewer-prompt.md)" [label="re-review (same implementer, cumulative)"];
    "Spec reviewer subagent confirms code matches spec?" -> "Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent (./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md)" [label="yes"];
    "Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent (./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md)" -> "Code quality reviewer subagent approves?";
    "Code quality reviewer subagent approves?" -> "Implementer subagent fixes quality issues" [label="no"];
    "Implementer subagent fixes quality issues" -> "Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent (./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md)" [label="re-review (same implementer, cumulative)"];
    "Code quality reviewer subagent approves?" -> "Tick task in progress file" [label="yes"];
    "Tick task in progress file" -> "More tasks remain?";
    "More tasks remain?" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent (./implementer-prompt.md)" [label="yes"];
    "More tasks remain?" -> "Dispatch final code reviewer subagent for entire implementation" [label="no"];
    "Dispatch final code reviewer subagent for entire implementation" -> "Use finishing-a-development-branch";
}
```

A reviewer batches same-shape findings into one pass rather than reporting them one at a time — the implementer fixes the batch, not each instance separately.

## Progress File

The controller tracks tasks in `.claude/plans/<plan-basename>.progress.local.md` (`<plan-basename>` is the plan's filename without `.md`); native task-list tools are not the mechanism because current models do not have them:

- First line names the plan; one checkbox per task.
- If the file already exists, reuse it and its ticks instead of recreating it.
- At creation, run `git check-ignore -q` on it; if that fails, append `.claude/plans/*.progress.local.md` to the file named by `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude`.
- Tick a task's box once its code quality reviewer approves.
- Delete it after the final code reviewer approves — before invoking finishing-a-development-branch, passing the plan path (`docs/plans/<plan-basename>.md`) so its plan audit reads this plan.
- An interrupted run leaves it in place; the STATE.md handoff (session-continuity) points at it.
- The session's native task list is the alternative only when the model offers one: Claude Code exposes its native task-list tools only on Claude 3.x, Opus 4.0–4.7, Sonnet 4.0–4.6 and Haiku 4.5 (CLI 2.1.233; verified on 2.1.268); `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1` restores them elsewhere.

```bash
plan=docs/plans/<plan-basename>.md
progress=".claude/plans/$(basename "$plan" .md).progress.local.md"
mkdir -p .claude/plans
if [ ! -f "$progress" ]; then   # an existing file keeps its ticks
  printf '# Progress: %s\n\n' "$plan" > "$progress"
  # then append one "- [ ] Task N: <title>" line per task in the plan
fi
git check-ignore -q "$progress" || {   # projects scaffolded before v3.6.0 lack the ignore rule
  if exclude="$(git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude 2>/dev/null)" && [ -n "$exclude" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$exclude")"
    echo '.claude/plans/*.progress.local.md' >> "$exclude"
  else
    echo "warning: not a git repository - add .claude/plans/*.progress.local.md to your ignore rules yourself" >&2
  fi
}
```

## Prompt Templates

- `./implementer-prompt.md` - Dispatch implementer subagent
- `./spec-reviewer-prompt.md` - Dispatch spec compliance reviewer subagent
- `./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md` - Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Read plan file once: docs/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Extract all 5 tasks with full text and context]
[Create .claude/plans/feature-plan.progress.local.md with one checkbox per task]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Get Task 1 text and context (already extracted)]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.claude/hooks/)"

Implementer: "Got it. Implementing now..."
[Later] Implementer:
  - Implemented install-hook command
  - Added tests, 5/5 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force flag, added it
  - Committed

[Dispatch spec compliance reviewer]
Spec reviewer: ✅ Spec compliant - all requirements met, nothing extra

[Get git SHAs, dispatch code quality reviewer]
Code reviewer: Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Approved.

[Mark Task 1 complete]

Task 2: Recovery modes

[Get Task 2 text and context (already extracted)]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Implementer: [No questions, proceeds]
Implementer:
  - Added verify/repair modes
  - 8/8 tests passing
  - Self-review: All good
  - Committed

[Dispatch spec compliance reviewer]
Spec reviewer: ❌ Issues:
  - Missing: Progress reporting (spec says "report every 100 items")
  - Extra: Added --json flag (not requested)

[Implementer fixes issues]
Implementer: Removed --json flag, added progress reporting

[Spec reviewer reviews again]
Spec reviewer: ✅ Spec compliant now

[Dispatch code quality reviewer]
Code reviewer: Strengths: Solid. Issues (Important): Magic number (100)

[Implementer fixes]
Implementer: Extracted PROGRESS_INTERVAL constant

[Code reviewer reviews again]
Code reviewer: ✅ Approved

[Mark Task 2 complete]

...

[After all tasks]
[Dispatch final code-reviewer]
Final reviewer: All requirements met, ready to merge

[Final reviewer approved: delete .claude/plans/feature-plan.progress.local.md]

Done!
```

## Advantages

**vs. Manual execution:**
- Subagents follow TDD naturally
- Fresh context per task (no confusion)
- Parallel-safe (subagents don't interfere)
- Subagent can ask questions (before AND during work)

**vs. Executing Plans:**
- Same session (no handoff)
- Continuous progress (no waiting)
- Review checkpoints automatic

**Efficiency gains:**
- No file reading overhead (controller provides full text)
- Controller curates exactly what context is needed
- Subagent gets complete information upfront
- Questions surfaced before work begins (not after)

**Quality gates:**
- Self-review catches issues before handoff
- Two-stage review: spec compliance, then code quality
- Review loops ensure fixes actually work
- Spec compliance prevents over/under-building
- Code quality ensures implementation is well-built

**Cost:**
- More subagent invocations (implementer + 2 reviewers per task)
- Controller does more prep work (extracting all tasks upfront)
- Review loops add iterations
- But catches issues early (cheaper than debugging later)

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
- Skip reviews (spec compliance OR code quality)
- Proceed with unfixed issues
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- Skip scene-setting context (subagent needs to understand where task fits)
- Ignore subagent questions (answer before letting them proceed)
- Accept "close enough" on spec compliance (spec reviewer found issues = not done)
- Skip review loops (reviewer found issues = implementer fixes = review again)
- Let implementer self-review replace actual review (both are needed)
- **Start code quality review before spec compliance is ✅** (wrong order)
- Move to next task while either review has open issues

**If subagent asks questions:**
- Answer clearly and completely
- Provide additional context if needed
- Don't rush them into implementation

**If reviewer finds issues:**
- Continue the same implementer, not a new one — in Claude Code, spawn it with a unique name (e.g. `implementer-task-3`) and resume it by sending it a message addressed to that name
- Batch same-shape findings into one message rather than sending them one at a time
- If the harness cannot resume it, or no reply arrives within your wait window, re-dispatch a fresh implementer carrying the prior report and all findings
- Reviewer re-reviews the cumulative range from the pre-task commit (BASE pinned) — not just the latest fix
- Five rounds per review phase (spec compliance, then quality); on the fifth, mark the task blocked in the progress file with `— BLOCKED: <reason>` and escalate
- Don't skip the re-review

**If subagent fails task:**
- Dispatch fix subagent with specific instructions
- Don't try to fix manually (context pollution)

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting
- **writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **requesting-code-review** - Code review template for reviewer subagents
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks

**Subagents should use:**
- **test-driven-development** - Subagents follow TDD for each task

**Alternative workflow:**
- **executing-plans** - Use for parallel session instead of same-session execution
