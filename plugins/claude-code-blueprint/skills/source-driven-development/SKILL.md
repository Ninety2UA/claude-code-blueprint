# Source-Driven Development

> Adapted from [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) (MIT). Codifies the citation discipline at write-time. Composes with the `sdd-cache` hook (HTTP-revalidating WebFetch cache) so repeated doc lookups are cheap.

## Overview

Every framework-specific code decision must be backed by a citation to official documentation. Don't implement from memory — verify, cite, and let the user see your sources. Training data goes stale, APIs get deprecated, best practices evolve. This skill ensures the user gets code they can trust because every framework-specific pattern traces back to a URL they can check.

## When to Use

- Writing code that touches a framework or library API (React hooks, Next.js routes, Django views, Rails controllers, Prisma queries, Express middleware, Tailwind config, etc.)
- Generating boilerplate or starter patterns that will be copied
- The user explicitly asks for documented, verified, or "correct" implementation
- Implementing features where the framework's recommended approach matters (forms, routing, data fetching, state management, auth)
- Reviewing or improving code that uses framework-specific patterns
- Any time you are about to write framework-specific code from memory

## When NOT to Use

- Correctness does not depend on a specific version (renaming variables, fixing typos, moving files)
- Pure logic that works the same across all versions (loops, conditionals, data structures)
- The user explicitly wants speed over verification ("just do it quickly")
- Internal-only utilities with no framework surface

## The Process

```
DETECT ──→ FETCH ──→ IMPLEMENT ──→ CITE
  │          │           │            │
  ▼          ▼           ▼            ▼
 What       Get the    Follow the   Show your
 stack?     relevant   documented   sources
            docs       patterns
```

### Step 1: Detect Stack and Versions

Read the project's dependency file to identify exact versions:

```
package.json / package-lock.json     → Node/React/Vue/Angular/Svelte/Next/etc.
composer.json / composer.lock        → PHP/Symfony/Laravel
requirements.txt / pyproject.toml    → Python/Django/Flask/FastAPI
go.mod                                → Go
Cargo.toml                            → Rust
Gemfile / Gemfile.lock                → Ruby/Rails
```

State what you found explicitly:

```
STACK DETECTED:
- React 19.1.0 (from package.json)
- Vite 6.2.0
- Tailwind CSS 4.0.3
→ Fetching official docs for the relevant patterns.
```

If versions are missing or ambiguous, **ask the user**. Don't guess — the version determines which patterns are correct.

If a major framework upgrade is in flight (e.g. v3 deps mixed with v4), surface that too — pick the version the file you're editing actually targets.

### Step 2: Fetch Official Documentation

Fetch the specific documentation page for the feature you're implementing. Not the homepage, not the full docs — the relevant page.

**Source hierarchy (in order of authority):**

| Priority | Source | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Official documentation | react.dev, docs.djangoproject.com, symfony.com/doc, nextjs.org/docs |
| 2 | Official blog / changelog | react.dev/blog, nextjs.org/blog, github.com/.../releases |
| 3 | Web standards references | MDN, web.dev, html.spec.whatwg.org |
| 4 | Browser/runtime compatibility | caniuse.com, node.green |

**Not authoritative — never cite as primary sources:**

- Stack Overflow answers
- Blog posts or tutorials (even popular ones)
- AI-generated documentation or summaries
- Your own training data — that's the whole point: verify it

**Be precise with what you fetch:**

```
BAD:  Fetch the React homepage
GOOD: Fetch react.dev/reference/react/useActionState

BAD:  Search "django authentication best practices"
GOOD: Fetch docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/auth/
```

After fetching, extract the key patterns and note any deprecation warnings or migration guidance.

When official sources conflict with each other (e.g. a migration guide contradicts the API reference), surface the discrepancy to the user and verify which pattern actually works against the detected version.

**Repeat fetches are cheap.** The `sdd-cache` hook revalidates each WebFetch via HTTP `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since`; on a `304 Not Modified` it serves the prior body without an actual re-download. Don't skip fetching to "save tokens" — the cache makes the second look-up effectively free.

### Step 3: Implement Following Documented Patterns

Write code that matches what the documentation shows:

- Use the API signatures from the docs, not from memory
- If the docs show a new way to do something, use the new way
- If the docs deprecate a pattern, don't use the deprecated version
- If the docs don't cover something, flag it as unverified

**When docs conflict with existing project code:**

```
CONFLICT DETECTED:
The existing codebase uses useState for form loading state,
but React 19 docs recommend useActionState for this pattern.
(Source: react.dev/reference/react/useActionState)

Options:
A) Use the modern pattern (useActionState) — consistent with current docs
B) Match existing code (useState) — consistent with codebase
→ Which approach do you prefer?
```

Surface the conflict. Don't silently pick one. (Codebase consistency may still win — that's the user's call.)

### Step 4: Cite Your Sources

Every framework-specific pattern gets a citation. The user must be able to verify every decision.

**In code comments (only when the pattern is non-obvious or version-sensitive):**

```typescript
// React 19 form handling with useActionState
// Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState#usage
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(submitOrder, initialState);
```

**In conversation:**

```
I'm using useActionState instead of manual useState for the
form submission state. React 19 replaced the manual
isPending/setIsPending pattern with this hook.

Source: https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19#actions
"useTransition now supports async functions [...] to handle
pending states automatically"
```

**Citation rules:**

- Full URLs, not shortened
- Prefer deep links with anchors (e.g. `/useActionState#usage` over `/useActionState`) — anchors survive doc restructuring better than top-level pages
- Quote the relevant passage when it supports a non-obvious decision
- Include browser/runtime support data when recommending platform features
- If you cannot find documentation for a pattern, say so explicitly:

```
UNVERIFIED: I could not find official documentation for this
pattern. This is based on training data and may be outdated.
Verify before using in production.
```

`UNVERIFIED:` is a literal token. Honesty about what you couldn't verify is more valuable than false confidence — and it lets reviewers know exactly where to look.

## Composition

- **Before:** `framework-docs-researcher` agent gathers a research brief at planning time. This skill governs how those docs are used at write-time.
- **During:** Use within `executing-plans` and `iterative-refinement` whenever a step touches framework code.
- **After:** `code-reviewer` and `findings-synthesizer` should flag uncited framework patterns and `UNVERIFIED:` blocks left in shipped code.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'm confident about this API" | Confidence is not evidence. Training data contains outdated patterns that look correct but break against current versions. Verify. |
| "Fetching docs wastes tokens" | Hallucinating an API wastes more. The user debugs for an hour, then discovers the function signature changed. With `sdd-cache`, repeat fetches cost an HTTP HEAD round-trip. |
| "The docs won't have what I need" | If the docs don't cover it, that's valuable information — the pattern may not be officially recommended. Flag as `UNVERIFIED:`. |
| "I'll just mention it might be outdated" | A vague disclaimer doesn't help. Either verify and cite, or clearly flag with `UNVERIFIED:`. Hedging without specificity is the worst option. |
| "This is a simple task, no need to check" | Simple tasks with wrong patterns become templates. The user copies your deprecated form handler into ten components before discovering the modern approach exists. |

## Red Flags

- Writing framework-specific code without checking the docs for the detected version
- Using "I believe" / "I think" about an API instead of citing the source
- Implementing a pattern without knowing which version it applies to
- Citing Stack Overflow or blog posts instead of official documentation
- Using deprecated APIs because they appear in training data
- Not reading the dependency file before implementing
- Delivering code without source citations for non-obvious framework decisions
- Fetching an entire docs site when only one page is relevant

## Verification

After implementing with source-driven development:

- [ ] Framework and library versions were identified from the dependency file
- [ ] Official documentation was fetched for each framework-specific pattern
- [ ] All sources are official documentation, not blog posts or training data
- [ ] Code follows the patterns shown in the current version's documentation
- [ ] Non-trivial decisions include source citations with full URLs
- [ ] No deprecated APIs are used (checked against migration guides)
- [ ] Conflicts between docs and existing code were surfaced to the user
- [ ] Anything that could not be verified is explicitly flagged `UNVERIFIED:`
