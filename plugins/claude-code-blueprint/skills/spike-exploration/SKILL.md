# Spike / Exploration

## Overview

A spike is a timeboxed investigation to reduce uncertainty. The output is knowledge, not production code. Spikes answer questions like "can we do X?", "how does Y work?", and "which approach is better?"

**Core principle:** The deliverable of a spike is a decision, not a feature. Write throwaway code. Explore fast. Document what you learned.

## When to Use

- You don't know if an approach is feasible
- You need to choose between two or more technologies or architectures
- You're integrating with an unfamiliar API or system
- The team is debating an approach and no one has evidence
- A task estimate feels like a guess because the unknowns are too large
- You're about to build something you've never built before

**Don't use when:**
- The approach is clear and the question is just "how long will it take" (that's estimation, not a spike)
- You're procrastinating on implementation by over-researching (set a timebox and honor it)
- The question can be answered by reading documentation (just read it)

## The Iron Law

<HARD-GATE>
A spike has a QUESTION and a TIMEBOX. If you don't have both before starting, you're not doing a spike — you're wandering. Define both before writing any code.
</HARD-GATE>

## Process

### Step 1: Define the Spike

Write down exactly three things:

```markdown
## Spike: [descriptive title]

**Question:** [The specific question this spike will answer]
**Timebox:** [Maximum time to spend — 1-4 hours typical]
**Success criteria:** [What constitutes a sufficient answer — doesn't need to be "yes it works"]
```

Examples of good spike questions:
- "Can we render 10K rows in the table without virtual scrolling?"
- "Does the Stripe API support partial captures for our use case?"
- "Is SQLite fast enough for our expected write throughput?"
- "Can we run the ML model in the browser with acceptable latency?"

Examples of bad spike questions:
- "How should we build the payments system?" (too broad — narrow to a specific uncertainty)
- "Is React good?" (subjective — reframe as measurable: "Can React Server Components reduce our bundle by 40%?")

### Step 2: Explore

Rules for spike code:

1. **No tests required** — this code is throwaway
2. **No code review required** — it won't ship
3. **No style standards** — hack freely, hardcode values, skip error handling
4. **Branch or scratch directory** — keep spike code separate from main
5. **Focus on the question** — resist the urge to build the whole feature

```bash
# Create a spike branch
git checkout -b spike/[descriptive-name]

# Or use a scratch directory
mkdir -p docs/research/spikes/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]
```

### Step 3: Gather Evidence

While exploring, collect evidence that answers the question:

- **Benchmarks** — timing data, memory usage, throughput numbers
- **API responses** — actual payloads, error codes, edge cases
- **Compatibility** — what works, what doesn't, what's undocumented
- **Prototype screenshots** — if visual, capture what you built
- **Code snippets** — the minimum code that proves/disproves feasibility

### Step 4: Write the Spike Report

When the timebox expires (or you have your answer), write a report:

```markdown
## Spike Report: [title]

**Question:** [the original question]
**Answer:** [YES/NO/PARTIALLY — one sentence]
**Timebox:** [planned] | **Actual:** [actual time spent]

### Findings

[2-5 bullet points of what you learned]

### Evidence

[Benchmarks, screenshots, code snippets, API responses]

### Recommendation

[What the team should do based on these findings]

### Risks Identified

[Anything surprising or concerning discovered during the spike]
```

Save the report to: `docs/research/spikes/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md`

### Step 5: Clean Up

1. **Don't merge spike code** — it's throwaway by definition
2. **Delete the spike branch** (or archive it with a `spike/` prefix)
3. **Keep the report** — the knowledge is the deliverable
4. **Create implementation tasks** — if the spike was successful, create plan tasks based on what you learned

## Spike Patterns

### A/B Comparison Spike

Comparing two approaches:

```markdown
## Spike: PostgreSQL vs. SQLite for local-first sync

**Question:** Which database handles our offline-first sync requirements better?
**Timebox:** 3 hours

### Approach A: PostgreSQL + logical replication
- [findings]

### Approach B: SQLite + cr-sqlite
- [findings]

### Comparison Matrix
| Criterion | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Offline support | ... | ... |
| Sync complexity | ... | ... |
| Query performance | ... | ... |

### Recommendation: [choice] because [evidence-based reasoning]
```

### Feasibility Spike

Can we do this at all?

```markdown
## Spike: Browser-based PDF generation

**Question:** Can we generate PDFs client-side without a server round-trip?
**Timebox:** 2 hours

### Tested Libraries
1. jsPDF — [result]
2. pdf-lib — [result]
3. Puppeteer in WASM — [result]

### Answer: YES, using pdf-lib. Limitations: [list]
```

### Integration Spike

How does this external system work?

```markdown
## Spike: Stripe Connect onboarding flow

**Question:** What's the minimum integration for marketplace seller onboarding?
**Timebox:** 2 hours

### API Endpoints Used
- [endpoint]: [what it does, gotchas]

### Auth Flow
- [sequence of calls]

### Undocumented Behavior
- [anything surprising]
```

## Timebox Discipline

When the timebox expires:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Question answered** | Write report, move on |
| **Partial answer** | Write what you know, note remaining unknowns, decide: extend or accept uncertainty |
| **No answer** | Write what you tried, why it didn't work, recommend next steps |
| **Found a bigger problem** | Document it, stop the spike, escalate to the team |

**Never extend a timebox by more than 50%.** If a 2-hour spike isn't answered in 3 hours, the question is probably too broad — split it into smaller spikes.

## Common Mistakes

**Spike becomes a prototype** — You found something that works and kept building. Stop. Write the report. Create implementation tasks. The spike code is throwaway.

**No timebox** — "I'll just explore for a bit" turns into a full day. Set a timer.

**No question** — "Let's spike on payments" is not a spike. "Can Stripe handle split payments to 3 parties?" is.

**Merging spike code** — Spike code is written fast with no tests, no error handling, and hardcoded values. It's evidence, not implementation. Rewrite it properly.

**Skipping the report** — The code will be deleted. If you don't write down what you learned, the spike was wasted time.

## Integration with Other Skills

| Situation | Skill |
|-----------|-------|
| Spike succeeded, need to plan implementation | writing-plans |
| Spike revealed the approach is too complex | brainstorming (re-explore alternatives) |
| Spike found a bug in existing code | systematic-debugging |
| Spike compared dependencies | dependency-management |
| Spike findings affect architecture | Document in docs/decisions/ as an ADR |
