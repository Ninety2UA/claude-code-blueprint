# Dependency Management

## Overview

Dependencies are the biggest source of invisible risk. Every dependency you add is code you don't control, maintained by people you don't know, on a schedule you can't predict. Manage them deliberately.

**Core principle:** Fewer dependencies, carefully chosen, regularly updated. Every addition is a long-term commitment.

## When to Use

- Adding a new dependency to the project
- Upgrading existing dependencies (minor, major, or security patches)
- Removing a dependency or replacing it with a lighter alternative
- Auditing dependencies after a security advisory
- Evaluating whether to build vs. install

**Don't use when:**
- Installing dev tooling that doesn't ship with the product (linters, formatters)
- Pinning a version temporarily during debugging (just do it, create a BACKLOG item to revisit)

## Phase 1: Evaluate Before Adding

Before running `install` or adding to the manifest, answer these questions:

### The Five Gates

| Gate | Question | Red Flag |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Necessity** | Can we do this with stdlib or existing deps? | Adding a dep for < 50 lines of code |
| **Maintenance** | Is it actively maintained? When was the last release? | No commits in 12+ months, open security issues |
| **Size** | What's the install footprint? How many transitive deps? | > 50 transitive deps for a utility function |
| **License** | Is the license compatible with our project? | GPL in a proprietary project, SSPL in SaaS |
| **Security** | Any known vulnerabilities? Is there an audit history? | Unpatched CVEs, no security policy |

### Research Checklist

```
- [ ] Check npm/PyPI/crates.io/rubygems for download trends and alternatives
- [ ] Read the README — does it solve your actual problem?
- [ ] Check the issue tracker — are bugs addressed or ignored?
- [ ] Count transitive dependencies (npm ls --all, pip show, bundle list)
- [ ] Check license compatibility
- [ ] Run security audit (npm audit, pip-audit, bundle-audit, cargo audit)
```

### Build vs. Install Decision

Build it yourself when:
- The functionality is < 100 lines
- You only need a small fraction of the library's capability
- The library has a large dependency tree for what you need
- You need precise control over behavior or performance

Install a library when:
- The problem domain is complex (crypto, parsing, image processing)
- The library is well-maintained and widely used
- Rolling your own would introduce security risk
- The library handles edge cases you'd miss

## Phase 2: Adding a Dependency

1. **Install the exact version** — use lockfile pinning
   ```bash
   # Good: pinned version
   npm install package@^2.3.0
   pip install 'package>=2.3,<3.0'
   bundle add package --version '~> 2.3'
   cargo add package@2.3

   # Bad: unpinned
   npm install package
   pip install package
   ```

2. **Verify lockfile updated** — commit the lockfile with the dependency addition
   ```bash
   git add package.json package-lock.json  # or equivalent
   ```

3. **Run full test suite** — ensure nothing breaks with the new dependency

4. **Document why** — add a brief comment in the commit message explaining the choice
   ```
   feat(deps): add zod for runtime schema validation

   Chosen over joi (smaller bundle, TypeScript-native, zero deps).
   Evaluated: joi, yup, zod, ajv. Zod won on type inference + size.
   ```

## Phase 3: Upgrading Dependencies

### Upgrade Strategy

| Type | Frequency | Process |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Security patches** | Immediately | Apply, test, deploy |
| **Patch versions** (x.x.PATCH) | Weekly/biweekly | Batch update, test, deploy |
| **Minor versions** (x.MINOR.x) | Monthly | Review changelogs, test, deploy |
| **Major versions** (MAJOR.x.x) | Plan explicitly | Read migration guide, create plan, test thoroughly |

### Upgrade Checklist

```
- [ ] Read the changelog/release notes for breaking changes
- [ ] Check if migration guide exists (for major versions)
- [ ] Update dependency in manifest
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Check for deprecation warnings in test output
- [ ] Verify build output (bundle size, compile time)
- [ ] Test critical paths manually if UI/API changed
- [ ] Commit lockfile with the upgrade
```

### Major Version Upgrades

Major upgrades are features, not chores. Treat them as such:

1. Create a branch for the upgrade
2. Read the full migration guide
3. Use the migration-planning skill if the upgrade touches > 5 files
4. Run the test suite after each migration step
5. Don't bundle major upgrades with feature work

## Phase 4: Removing Dependencies

Removing a dependency is always a win if the replacement is simpler.

1. **Search for all imports/requires** of the dependency
2. **Replace with stdlib or inline code** where possible
3. **Remove from manifest** (package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
4. **Remove from lockfile** (regenerate it)
5. **Run full test suite**
6. **Check for orphaned transitive deps** that are no longer needed

## Common Mistakes

**"Just update everything"** — Batch-updating all deps at once makes it impossible to isolate which upgrade broke something. Update in logical groups.

**Ignoring lockfiles** — Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds. Always commit them. Never `.gitignore` them.

**Vendoring without a plan** — If you vendor a dependency, you own its maintenance. Create a BACKLOG item to check for updates quarterly.

**Choosing by GitHub stars** — Stars measure popularity, not quality. A 500-star library with zero deps and a clean API beats a 50K-star framework you use 2% of.

**Not reading changelogs** — "It's just a minor version" — until it deprecates the function you depend on. Always read release notes.

## Integration with Other Skills

| Situation | Skill |
|-----------|-------|
| Major upgrade is complex, needs a plan | writing-plans + migration-planning |
| Security vulnerability discovered | systematic-debugging (to assess impact) |
| Evaluating build-vs-buy for a feature | brainstorming |
| Dependency broke the build | systematic-debugging |
