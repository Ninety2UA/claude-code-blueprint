# /deepen — Parallel Plan Enrichment

Dispatch multiple research agents in parallel to enrich an existing plan with deeper context, best practices, prior solutions, and framework-specific guidance.

**Announce at start:** "Deepening plan with parallel research agents."

## Step 1: Load the Plan

If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a plan file path, read it. Otherwise, find the most recent plan in `docs/plans/` (sort by date prefix, pick latest).

If no plan file found, report: "No plan file found. Write a plan first with `/plan` or specify a path."

Read the full plan file. Identify:
- Each section/task in the plan
- Technologies, frameworks, and libraries referenced
- Files and modules that will be modified
- The overall feature being built

## Step 2: Load Project Configuration

Check `blueprint.local.md` for configured research agents. If not found, use defaults.

**Default research agents:**
- **learnings-researcher** — search `docs/solutions/` for relevant past solutions
- **best-practices-researcher** — industry standards for the approach
- **framework-docs-researcher** — current docs for libraries being used
- **codebase-context-mapper** — files and dependencies affected by the change
- **git-history-analyzer** — historical context for files being modified

## Step 3: Dispatch All Researchers in Parallel

Use the Task tool to dispatch all selected agents simultaneously. Each agent gets the plan content plus a focused research prompt:

```
Task("learnings-researcher: Search docs/solutions/ for prior work related to: [feature]. Plan context: [plan summary]. Return findings as bullet points organized by plan section.")

Task("best-practices-researcher: Research industry best practices for: [technologies/patterns in plan]. Return recommendations organized by plan section.")

Task("framework-docs-researcher: Gather current documentation for: [frameworks referenced in plan]. Focus on API patterns, version constraints, and gotchas. Return findings organized by plan section.")

Task("codebase-context-mapper: Map all files and dependencies affected by: [feature description]. Identify integration points, shared utilities, and potential conflicts. Return file map organized by plan section.")

Task("git-history-analyzer: Analyze git history for files referenced in this plan: [file list]. Identify patterns, past refactors, and contributors. Return historical context organized by plan section.")
```

**Important:** Dispatch ALL agents in a single message to maximize parallelism.

## Step 4: Collect and Merge

When all agents return, integrate their findings into the plan:

For each section of the plan, add a `### Research Notes` subsection containing:
- Relevant prior solutions (from learnings-researcher)
- Best practices and recommendations (from best-practices-researcher)
- Framework constraints and API notes (from framework-docs-researcher)
- File dependencies and integration points (from codebase-context-mapper)
- Historical context and patterns (from git-history-analyzer)

**Merge rules:**
- Do NOT change the plan's structure, tasks, or ordering
- Do NOT add new tasks — only add research context to existing ones
- Do NOT remove anything from the original plan
- Add findings as supplementary notes that inform implementation
- If researchers contradict each other, note both perspectives and flag for the implementer
- If a researcher found nothing relevant for a section, omit that section's entry (no empty notes)

## Step 5: Re-verify

After enrichment, dispatch the **plan-checker** agent on the updated plan to verify the research notes don't conflict with the plan's approach.

If the plan-checker finds new issues introduced by research (e.g., a best practice contradicts the plan's approach):
- Flag the conflict clearly in the plan
- Do NOT change the plan's approach — leave the decision to the implementer or the calling workflow

## Step 6: Report

Update the plan file with enriched content. Report:

```markdown
## Plan Deepened

- Research agents dispatched: [N]
- Sections enriched: [N] of [total]
- Prior solutions found: [N]
- Best practices added: [N]
- Framework notes added: [N]
- File dependencies mapped: [N]
- Historical patterns noted: [N]
- Conflicts flagged: [N]

Plan updated: [path to plan file]
```
