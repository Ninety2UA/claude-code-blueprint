# Migration Planning

## Overview

Create safe, reversible migration plans with explicit rollback procedures. Covers database schema changes, API version transitions, major dependency upgrades, and data transformations.

## When to Use

- Adding, modifying, or removing database tables/columns
- Transitioning between API versions
- Upgrading major dependencies (framework, ORM, runtime)
- Transforming existing data (backfills, format changes)
- Any change where "just deploy it" could corrupt data or break downstream systems

## The Iron Law

<HARD-GATE>
NO MIGRATION WITHOUT A ROLLBACK PLAN. Every migration step must have a documented reverse operation. If a step cannot be reversed, it must be explicitly marked as irreversible with a data backup requirement.
</HARD-GATE>

## Process

### Step 1: Impact Analysis

Before writing any migration code, analyze the blast radius:

**Data impact:**
- Which tables/collections are affected?
- How many rows/documents will be modified?
- Are there foreign key constraints or cascading effects?
- Is this change backward-compatible with the current application code?

**Service impact:**
- Which services read/write the affected data?
- Will there be downtime during migration?
- Can the migration run while the application is serving traffic?
- What happens to in-flight requests during migration?

**Dependency impact:**
- Do other teams or services depend on the schema/API being changed?
- Are there cached schema versions that need invalidating?
- Do ORMs need regeneration?

### Step 2: Design Migration Steps

Break the migration into atomic, ordered steps. Each step must be:
- **Independently deployable** — can be released without the next step
- **Backward-compatible** — old code works with new schema (expand-contract pattern)
- **Reversible** — has a documented rollback procedure

**Expand-Contract Pattern for Schema Changes:**
1. **Expand:** Add new column/table (old code ignores it)
2. **Migrate:** Backfill data from old to new structure
3. **Switch:** Update application code to use new structure
4. **Contract:** Remove old column/table (after verification period)

### Step 3: Write Rollback Plan

For each step, document the exact rollback:

```markdown
### Step N: [description]

**Forward:**
[SQL/code to apply the change]

**Rollback:**
[SQL/code to reverse the change]

**Rollback verification:**
[How to confirm the rollback worked]

**Irreversible?** No / Yes — requires backup of [table] before proceeding
```

### Step 4: Verification Plan

Define how to verify each step succeeded:

```markdown
### Verification for Step N

- [ ] Row count matches expected: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table]`
- [ ] No null values in required column: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table] WHERE [col] IS NULL`
- [ ] Application health check passes
- [ ] No errors in application logs for 5 minutes after migration
```

### Step 5: Execution Checklist

```markdown
## Pre-Migration
- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] Backup verified (test restore)
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled (if needed)
- [ ] Rollback procedure reviewed by team

## During Migration
- [ ] Step 1 applied and verified
- [ ] Step 2 applied and verified
- [ ] [etc.]

## Post-Migration
- [ ] Application health check passes
- [ ] No elevated error rates for 15 minutes
- [ ] Monitoring alerts reviewed
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of completion
```

## Quick Reference

| Migration Type | Key Risk | Key Mitigation |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Add column | None (additive) | Default value for existing rows |
| Remove column | Data loss | Verify no code references, backup first |
| Rename column | Breaking | Use expand-contract: add new, copy, drop old |
| Change type | Data loss | Add new column, convert, verify, drop old |
| Add table | None (additive) | Ensure foreign keys are correct |
| Drop table | Data loss | Backup, verify no references, grace period |
| Backfill data | Performance | Batch processing, off-peak hours |

## Common Mistakes

**Deploying code and migration simultaneously** — Deploy the migration first, verify it worked, then deploy the code that uses it. Never atomic "big bang" deployments.

**No rollback testing** — If you haven't tested the rollback, you don't have a rollback plan. You have a rollback hope.

**Forgetting in-flight requests** — A migration that takes 30 seconds means 30 seconds of potentially inconsistent state. Plan for what happens to requests during that window.

**Irreversible steps without backup** — If a step can't be undone (dropping a column, transforming data destructively), take a backup before that step, not just at the start.
