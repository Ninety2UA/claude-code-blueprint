# Wave Orchestration

## Overview

Execute a plan by grouping tasks into dependency-ordered waves. Within each wave, independent tasks run in parallel (one subagent per task). Between waves, an integration verifier ensures all tasks work together before the next wave begins.

**Core principle:** Maximize parallelism within dependency constraints. Independent tasks run concurrently; dependent tasks wait.

## When to Use

- Plan has 4+ tasks with mixed dependencies
- Some tasks are independent (can run in parallel)
- Some tasks depend on others (must wait)
- You want maximum speed without sacrificing correctness

**Don't use when:**
- All tasks are sequential (use autonomous-loop instead)
- All tasks are independent (use resolve-in-parallel instead)
- Plan has 1-3 tasks (overhead not worth it)

## The Wave Model

```
Wave 1: [Task A, Task B, Task C]  ← all independent, run in parallel
         │         │         │
         ▼         ▼         ▼
    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
    │   Integration Verification   │
    └─────────────────────────────┘
                  │
Wave 2: [Task D, Task E]         ← D depends on A, E depends on B
         │         │
         ▼         ▼
    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
    │   Integration Verification   │
    └─────────────────────────────┘
                  │
Wave 3: [Task F]                  ← depends on D and E
         │
         ▼
    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
    │   Final Verification         │
    └─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Process

### Step 1: Load and Parse the Plan

Read the plan file. For each task, identify:
- Task ID or number
- Description
- Dependencies (which tasks must complete first)
- Files it will modify (for conflict detection)

If the plan doesn't specify dependencies explicitly, infer them:
- Tasks that create something used by later tasks → dependency
- Tasks modifying the same file → same wave or sequential
- Tasks with no overlap → independent

### Step 2: Build the Dependency Graph

Organize tasks into waves:

```markdown
## Wave Plan

### Wave 1 (no dependencies)
- Task 1: Set up database schema
- Task 3: Create API route stubs
- Task 5: Add frontend page skeleton

### Wave 2 (depends on Wave 1)
- Task 2: Implement model logic (depends on Task 1)
- Task 4: Implement API handlers (depends on Task 3)

### Wave 3 (depends on Wave 2)
- Task 6: Wire frontend to API (depends on Tasks 4, 5)
- Task 7: Add integration tests (depends on Tasks 2, 4)
```

**Rules for wave assignment:**
- A task goes in the earliest wave where ALL its dependencies are satisfied
- Tasks in the same wave MUST NOT modify the same files
- If two independent tasks touch the same file, put one in a later wave

### Step 3: Present Wave Plan for Approval

Show the user the wave breakdown:
- How many waves
- Which tasks in each wave
- Which tasks run in parallel
- Estimated time savings vs sequential execution

Ask: **"Approve this wave plan? I'll execute Wave 1 first, verify, then Wave 2, etc."**

### Step 4: Execute Each Wave

For each wave:

#### 4a. Dispatch Parallel Subagents

For each task in the wave, dispatch an implementer subagent using the subagent-driven-development pattern. **Use `isolation: worktree`** to give each implementer an isolated copy of the repo, preventing file conflicts between parallel tasks:

```
Task("Implement Task [N]: [full task description].
Context: [relevant project context, file paths, conventions].
Constraints: Only modify [specific files]. Follow TDD.
Return: Summary of changes, files modified, test results.",
isolation: "worktree")
```

Dispatch ALL tasks in the wave in a single message for maximum parallelism.

**Why worktree isolation matters:** Without isolation, parallel implementers can overwrite each other's changes to the same files. Worktrees give each implementer a clean copy. Changes are merged back after the wave completes.

#### 4b. Collect Results

When all subagents return:
1. Read each summary
2. Note files modified by each
3. Check for unexpected overlaps

#### 4c. Integration Verification

Dispatch the **integration-verifier** agent:

```
Task("integration-verifier: Verify integration for Wave [N].
Tasks completed: [list with summaries].
Run full test suite and check for conflicts between task implementations.")
```

#### 4d. Handle Verification Results

- **PASS:** Proceed to next wave
- **ISSUES FOUND:** Fix issues before proceeding. Dispatch targeted fix agents for each issue.
- **FAIL:** Stop. Report failure to user. Do not proceed to next wave.

### Step 5: Final Verification

After all waves complete:

1. Run full test suite
2. Run build
3. Run lint
4. Dispatch **code-reviewer** for overall review

### Step 6: Report

```markdown
## Wave Orchestration Complete

### Execution Summary
| Wave | Tasks | Status | Duration |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| Wave 1 | Tasks 1, 3, 5 | Complete | [time] |
| Wave 2 | Tasks 2, 4 | Complete | [time] |
| Wave 3 | Tasks 6, 7 | Complete | [time] |

### Final Verification
- Tests: [X passing, Y failing]
- Build: [pass/fail]
- Lint: [pass/fail]

### Files Changed
[list of all files, grouped by task]

### Commits
[list of commits from all tasks]
```

## Comparison with Other Execution Skills

| Skill | Use When | Parallelism |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **wave-orchestration** | Mixed dependencies, 4+ tasks | Parallel within waves |
| **autonomous-loop** | Sequential tasks, retry needed | None (sequential) |
| **resolve-in-parallel** | All tasks independent | Full parallel |
| **subagent-driven-development** | Any plan, in-session | Sequential with review |
| **executing-plans** | Cross-session execution | Human-paced batches |

## Common Mistakes

**Putting dependent tasks in the same wave** — If Task B reads from the table Task A creates, they CANNOT be in the same wave. Task B must wait for Task A.

**Ignoring file conflicts** — Two tasks that both modify `src/utils/helpers.ts` will conflict even if logically independent. Put them in different waves.

**Skipping integration verification** — Each wave must pass integration before the next wave starts. Skipping creates cascading failures.

**Too many waves** — If your plan has 10 waves of 1 task each, it's just sequential execution with extra overhead. Restructure the plan for more parallelism.

**Too few waves** — If everything is in Wave 1, you're probably missing dependencies. Tasks that create schemas should precede tasks that use those schemas.
