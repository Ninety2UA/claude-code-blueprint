description: "Process BACKLOG.md — triage inbox items into prioritized tasks, specs, research, or park them."
---

Read BACKLOG.md and process items in the **Inbox** section:

1. Read `docs/context/GOALS.md` to understand current objectives, milestones, and non-goals
2. Read `docs/context/STATUS.md` to understand what's in flight and what's blocked
3. For each inbox item, determine:
   - **Task (clear and actionable):** Move to **Triaged** with priority tag (P0-P3) and type tag ([bug], [feature], [chore]). If P0/P1, also add to STATUS.md "Up Next"
   - **Bug (needs investigation):** Move to **Triaged** as `[bug]`. If it's blocking, suggest starting `/debug`
   - **Feature (needs design):** If small, move to **Triaged** as `[feature]`. If complex, suggest creating a spec in docs/specs/
   - **Research (needs exploration):** Move to **Triaged** as `[research]` or suggest creating a doc in docs/research/
   - **Idea (vague or future):** Move to **Parked** with reason
   - **Off-goal (doesn't align):** Flag to user — park it, drop it, or create a new goal for it
   - **Unclear:** Ask the user for clarification before triaging

4. Present the triage summary as a table:

   | Item | Action | Priority | Reasoning |
   |------|--------|----------|-----------|
   | [item] | [Triaged / Parked / Dropped / Needs clarification] | [P0-P3] | [brief reason] |

5. Ask: "Does this triage look right? Any changes before I update?"
6. After approval:
   - Move items from Inbox to Triaged or Parked in BACKLOG.md
   - Add P0/P1 items to STATUS.md "Up Next"
   - Commit: `docs: triage backlog — [N] items processed`
