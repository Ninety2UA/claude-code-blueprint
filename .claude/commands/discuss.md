# /discuss — Decision Capture

You are capturing decisions BEFORE planning begins. This prevents assumption drift and ensures planners honor user intent.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using /discuss to capture decisions before we plan. This ensures nothing gets lost or assumed."

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Goal

Ask the user to describe what they want to build or change. Listen for:
- **Explicit requirements** — features, behavior, constraints
- **Implicit preferences** — technology choices, patterns, trade-offs
- **Non-goals** — what this is NOT (scope boundaries)

### Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions

Use AskUserQuestion to present structured choices for ambiguous areas:
- Technology or approach choices (e.g., "REST vs GraphQL?")
- Scope decisions (e.g., "Include admin UI now or later?")
- Priority trade-offs (e.g., "Optimize for speed or flexibility?")

Ask 2-4 focused questions. Do NOT ask more than 4 at once. If more clarity is needed, ask in rounds.

### Step 3: Search for Prior Art

Before finalizing, search the project for relevant history:
1. Check `docs/decisions/` for related ADRs
2. Check `docs/plans/` for similar past plans
3. Check `docs/research/` for relevant research
4. Check CLAUDE.md Key Learnings for related entries

If you find relevant prior art, present it: "Found related decision in [file] — [summary]. Does this still apply?"

### Step 4: Lock Decisions

Write captured decisions to `docs/context/DECISIONS.md` in this format:

```markdown
# Locked Decisions — [Feature/Topic]

_Captured: YYYY-MM-DD_

## Decisions

- **[Decision 1]:** [What was decided and why]
- **[Decision 2]:** [What was decided and why]

## Non-Goals

- [What is explicitly out of scope]

## Open Questions

- [Anything still unresolved — planners should ask about these]
```

### Step 5: Confirm

Present the summary of locked decisions to the user.

Say: "These decisions are now locked for planning. Planners MUST honor them. Anything to change?"

## Rules

- Decisions marked as locked are NON-NEGOTIABLE for planners
- Open questions MUST be resolved before planning proceeds
- If the user changes a locked decision later, update DECISIONS.md
- Keep DECISIONS.md concise — decisions only, not discussion
- If `docs/context/DECISIONS.md` already exists, append new decisions (don't overwrite previous ones unless the user says to)
