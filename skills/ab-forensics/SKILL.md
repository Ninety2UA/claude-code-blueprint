# Forensics

When the ab-ship-pipeline or ab-orchestrate skill, or any iterative pipeline, ends without delivering, the operator needs to know why before retrying: re-running blindly often produces the same failure, just slower. This skill diagnoses a finished run, read-only, from its logs, run state, git state and planning artifacts. It is done when the report is written and the user has the summary and the Step 5 choice.

Ground every conclusion in specific evidence (commits, log lines, file timestamps, planning artifacts), because a guess written up as a finding sends the retry the wrong way; "unknown" is better than speculation.

## When to Use

- An ab-ship-pipeline run exited without delivering
- An ab-orchestrate run produced partial output across waves
- Iterative refinement hit max iterations without convergence
- A long-running session ended in an unexpected state
- The user resumes a project and finds inconsistent state

Not for live debugging of code bugs (the ab-systematic-debugging skill), active recovery or fix-forward (this skill only diagnoses), or routine status checks (the ab-project-status or ab-health-check skill).

## Inputs

The user usually gives one of:
- A run id (for example `ship-2026-04-15-1430`)
- A log path (for example `.agent-blueprint/run/logs/iteration-5.log`)
- A symptom ("the last ship run stopped at iteration 5")
- Nothing: then locate the most recent run yourself

## Process

### Step 1: Locate the artifact

If the user gave a path, use it. Otherwise list the newest logs:

```bash
ls -t .agent-blueprint/run/logs/*.log 2>/dev/null | head -3
```

Also read `.agent-blueprint/run/state.json` if it exists: its `status`, `stage`, `iteration`, `reason` and `decisions` say where the run stopped and why it thought so. Treat them as claims to check against the logs and git, not as findings.

If no logs exist, fall back to:
- Recent git activity (`git log --since='1 day ago' --oneline`)
- Pending changes (`git status --short`)
- Active session files (`ls .agent-blueprint/team/active.md .continue-here.md 2>/dev/null`) and team ledgers (`.agent-blueprint/team/*/ledger.md`)

A run in no-commit mode (`AGENT_BLUEPRINT_GIT_WRITABLE` was `0`, or `.agent-blueprint/run/commit-msg.md` exists) leaves its work in the working tree instead of commits, so there "no commits" is expected, not a missing artifact.

### Step 2: Investigate four anomaly categories

For each, gather evidence before drawing conclusions.

**1. Stuck execution loops**
- Same iteration block repeating with near-identical output?
- Same helper started 3+ times with no observable progress?
- Same test failing across iterations with no fix attempted?
- Evidence: count repeated phrases / same-file diffs in the log; check iteration timestamps (long iterations = thrashing).

**2. Missing or incomplete artifacts**
- Plan file references files that were never created?
- Tasks marked complete but no commits?
- Helper started but never returned?
- Evidence: cross-reference plan TODOs against `git log --oneline`, check for empty deliverable directories.

**3. Abandoned work in progress**
- WIP commits without follow-up?
- Branch with uncommitted changes that don't match the plan?
- Continue-here markers from a paused run?
- Evidence: `git stash list`, `.continue-here.md`, `git diff` against base branch.

**4. Crashes or sudden interruptions**
- Log ends mid-line or mid-tool-call?
- Exit code in log indicating non-zero termination?
- Hook timeout messages?
- System errors (rate limit, network, OOM)?
- Evidence: `tail` of log, look for error patterns, check timestamps for gaps.

### Step 3: Redact

Before producing the report, scrub sensitive content, because reports get pasted into issues and shared with teammates:

- API tokens, secrets, env values (replace with `<redacted>`)
- Full file paths inside the user's home directory (replace home with `~`)
- Email addresses and personal info appearing in evidence quotes
- Auth headers if any were logged

### Step 4: Produce report

**Working folder.** Blueprint working files live under `.agent-blueprint/` in the project root. Before the first write there, make sure `.agent-blueprint/.gitignore` exists and lists `run/`, `team/`, `review-runs/`, `cache/` and `.gitignore`, so run state and the ignore file itself stay out of commits while plans and notes stay tracked.

Write findings to `.agent-blueprint/forensics/<run-id-or-timestamp>.md` in the format of `references/report-template.md` § Format. If this run already has a report, extend it instead of starting a second one.

### Step 5: Offer next steps

After writing the report, summarize it inline in 200 words or fewer and offer the next steps.

**Asking the user.** Ask with your question tool if you have one, offering at most three options; otherwise ask in plain text with a numbered list. In a headless or unattended run nobody will answer: take the default named below, say so in your output, and log it in the run state's decisions if there is a run state.

Options: 1. Open a GitHub issue with the redacted report as its body. 2. Re-run with the parameter the diagnosis points at changed (name it). 3. Resume from the continue-here marker (offer it only when abandoned work was the diagnosis). Default when nobody answers: do none of them and stop with the report, because filing, retrying and resuming are the user's decisions.

## Rules

- **Read-only.** Apart from the report, change no source files, start no pipelines and retry nothing on your own, because a retry repeats the failure and buries its evidence before anyone knows the cause.
- **Evidence first.** Every claim cites a log line, commit sha or file; a claim you cannot cite goes under Unverifiable.
- **Redact before writing.** Reports may be shared in issues or pasted to teammates.
- **One report per run.** Don't investigate the same run again from scratch; extend the existing report.
- **UNKNOWN is valid.** If the logs are insufficient, say so. Padding the report with speculation is worse than admitting its limits.
- **Don't fix.** If you spot the obvious fix, name it under Recommended Next Action but don't apply it. Diagnosis and remediation are separate steps; mixing them hides what actually went wrong.
