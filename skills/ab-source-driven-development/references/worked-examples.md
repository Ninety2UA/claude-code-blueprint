# Sources and worked examples

Loaded on demand from SKILL.md when you want the full source hierarchy, or the shape of a stack report, a precise fetch, a conflict note or a citation.

## Source hierarchy

**Source hierarchy (in order of authority):**

| Priority | Source | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Official documentation | react.dev, docs.djangoproject.com, symfony.com/doc, nextjs.org/docs |
| 2 | Official blog / changelog | react.dev/blog, nextjs.org/blog, github.com/.../releases |
| 3 | Web standards references | MDN, web.dev, html.spec.whatwg.org |
| 4 | Browser/runtime compatibility | caniuse.com, node.green |

**Not authoritative — never cite as primary sources:**

- Stack Overflow answers
- Blog posts or tutorials (even popular ones)
- AI-generated documentation or summaries
- Your own training data — that's the whole point: verify it

## Stack detected

```
STACK DETECTED:
- React 19.1.0 (from package.json)
- Vite 6.2.0
- Tailwind CSS 4.0.3
→ Fetching official docs for the relevant patterns.
```

## Precise fetches

**Be precise with what you fetch:**

```
BAD:  Fetch the React homepage
GOOD: Fetch react.dev/reference/react/useActionState

BAD:  Search "django authentication best practices"
GOOD: Fetch docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/auth/
```

## Conflict with existing code

```
CONFLICT DETECTED:
The existing codebase uses useState for form loading state,
but React 19 docs recommend useActionState for this pattern.
(Source: react.dev/reference/react/useActionState)

Options:
A) Use the modern pattern (useActionState) — consistent with current docs
B) Match existing code (useState) — consistent with codebase
→ Which approach do you prefer?
```

## Citations

**In code comments (only when the pattern is non-obvious or version-sensitive):**

```typescript
// React 19 form handling with useActionState
// Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState#usage
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(submitOrder, initialState);
```

**In conversation:**

```
I'm using useActionState instead of manual useState for the
form submission state. React 19 replaced the manual
isPending/setIsPending pattern with this hook.

Source: https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19#actions
"useTransition now supports async functions [...] to handle
pending states automatically"
```
