# ab-autonomous-loop — loop details

Loaded on demand from SKILL.md when a step points here: when not to use the skill, the pre-flight danger scan, the loop diagram, task classes, circuit-breaker and risk-score mechanics, limits, integration with other skills, and common mistakes.

## When Not to Use

- Tasks require human decisions between steps: use the ab-executing-plans skill, which has checkpoints.
- Tasks are independent and can run in parallel: use the ab-resolve-in-parallel skill (or the ab-orchestrate skill for a whole plan as team work).
- You are exploring or unsure of the approach: use the ab-brainstorming or ab-writing-plans skill first.

It fits a multi-step implementation plan, a PRD or task list worked end to end, or five or more sequential tasks that need no human input between them.

## Pre-flight danger scan

Advisory, once before the first task. Scan the plan for irreversible operations (deleting data, shared-database migrations, force-push, publishing outside the repo), protected-branch pushes, and deleting or skipping tests. Route each hit through the decision boundary in the ab-executing-plans skill; the scan never stops the loop by itself.

## Task classes

| Classification | Meaning | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Independent** | Can be done in any order | Adding unrelated tests |
| **Sequential** | Must follow previous task | Migration before code that uses new schema |
| **Parallelizable** | Can run concurrently | Independent module implementations |

## Circuit breaker

Besides the per-task retry limit, track the health of the whole loop to detect stalls.

**Tracking state (kept across iterations):**
```
consecutive_no_progress = 0    # increments when no task completes in a full loop pass
consecutive_same_error = 0     # increments when the same error message appears
last_error_signature = ""      # normalized error message for comparison
attempts_per_task = []         # track retry count for each completed task (for trend detection)
files_modified_count = {}      # track how many tasks touch each file path
```

**Thresholds (configurable):**

| Threshold | Default | What It Detects |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD` | 3 | Loop is spinning without completing any task |
| `SAME_ERROR_THRESHOLD` | 5 | Same error repeating — root cause needs human input |
| `RISING_DIFFICULTY_THRESHOLD` | 3 consecutive tasks with increasing retry count | Complexity compounding — approach is degrading |
| `HOT_FILE_THRESHOLD` | Same file modified by 4+ different tasks | God object emerging — one file absorbing too much responsibility |

**After each loop iteration:**

1. If a task was completed this iteration, reset `consecutive_no_progress` to 0.
2. If no task was completed, increment `consecutive_no_progress`.
3. If the error message matches `last_error_signature`, increment `consecutive_same_error`.
4. If the error message is different, reset `consecutive_same_error` to 0 and update `last_error_signature`.

**Circuit breaker triggers:**

```
if consecutive_no_progress >= NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD:
    stop: "Circuit breaker: No progress in [N] consecutive iterations."

if consecutive_same_error >= SAME_ERROR_THRESHOLD:
    stop: "Circuit breaker: Same error repeated [N] times."

if last 3 tasks each required more retries than the previous:
    stop: "Circuit breaker: Rising difficulty — tasks are getting harder, not easier."

if any file has been modified by 4+ different tasks:
    stop: "Circuit breaker: Hot file detected — [file] modified by [N] tasks."
```

A tripped breaker is not retried: the loop stops and escalates (SKILL.md Step 4), because the signal means more attempts of the same kind will not help.

**Error signature normalization:** Strip line numbers, timestamps, and variable values from error messages before comparison. Compare the structural pattern, not the exact string. Example: `"TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined at line 42"` → `"TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined"`.

## Risk score

Besides the circuit-breaker thresholds, keep an additive risk score (the WTF-likelihood score) across the whole loop run. It catches gradual degradation that no single threshold trips on.

**Tracking (kept across all iterations):**
```
wtf_score = 0%
```

**Risk accumulation:**

| Event | Score Added | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Each revert (`git revert`, or undoing a task's working-tree changes in no-commit mode) | +15% | Reverts mean changes made things worse |
| Each fix touching >3 files | +5% | Multi-file changes are riskier |
| After fix 15 | +1% per additional fix | Volume itself is a risk signal |
| Touching files unrelated to the current task | +20% | Scope creep is the biggest risk |

**Threshold:** when `wtf_score` passes 20%, stop and escalate (SKILL.md Step 4): show what the run has done so far and ask whether to continue. With nobody to answer, the run stops.

**Hard cap:** 50 total changes across the entire loop run, regardless of wtf_score.

**Note:** test-only changes (regression tests, new test files) add nothing to wtf_score; only production code changes accumulate risk.

## Quick Reference

| Parameter | Default | Override |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Hard iteration ceiling | 20 loop passes | Fixed, no override. Count loop passes (SKILL.md Step 2) in context; at 20, stop with the Step 4 escalation. The same ceiling the ab-ship-pipeline skill applies across fresh sessions, counted there by the run state's `iteration`. It sits above every configurable cap: 3 retries per task, 50 total changes, and the ship runner's iteration cap (10). |
| Max retries per task | 3 | User can specify |
| No-progress circuit breaker | 3 iterations | User can specify |
| Same-error circuit breaker | 5 occurrences | User can specify |
| Rising difficulty circuit breaker | 3 consecutive tasks with increasing retries | User can specify |
| Hot file circuit breaker | 4+ tasks touching same file | User can specify |
| Batch size before checkpoint | All (autonomous) | User can request checkpoints every N tasks; with nobody to answer, a checkpoint continues |
| Backoff timing | 5s → 15s → 45s | Adjust for rate limits |
| Parallelizable tasks | Sequential | Dispatch via ab-resolve-in-parallel |

## Integration with Other Skills

| Situation | Skill to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Task requires writing code | Follow ab-test-driven-development (red-green-refactor) |
| Task fails and needs debugging | Use ab-systematic-debugging to find root cause |
| Multiple independent tasks ready | Dispatch via ab-resolve-in-parallel |
| Task requires a plan change | Stop loop, use ab-writing-plans to revise |
| All tasks done, ready to merge | Use ab-finishing-a-development-branch |
| Loop complete, end of session | Use ab-session-wrap to document |

## Common Mistakes

**Retrying the same approach** — the reflection before each retry (SKILL.md Step 2) exists to prevent this. If you cannot say what is different about the next attempt, you have not reflected enough, and the attempt will likely fail the same way.

**Skipping verification between tasks** — "I'll verify at the end" means five tasks of compounding bugs. Verify after every task.

**Not updating the plan** — a task completed but not marked `[x]` gets attempted again, so tick the checkbox as part of finishing the task.

**Continuing past fatal errors** — transient errors get retried. Fatal errors (missing dependency, wrong architecture) need human input; retrying what cannot succeed only burns the run.

**Giant tasks in the loop** — each task should take minutes, not hours. If a task is too large, break it into subtasks before entering the loop.

**Not committing between tasks** — commit after each successful task (in no-commit mode, record its message instead). If a later task breaks something, you can return to the last good state without losing earlier work.
